# Resume Book Project

## Overview
This project was created to help students upload their resumes and provide recruiters with easy access to those resumes. The platform is designed to streamline the process of resume submission and review, making it more efficient for both students and recruiters.

## How it Works
1. **Student Account Creation**: Students can create an account on the platform by providing some basic information.
2. **Resume Upload**: After creating an account, students can upload their resumes to the platform.
3. **Recruiter Account Creation**: Recruiters can create their own accounts on a separate section of the platform.
4. **Resume Access**: Once logged in, recruiters can view the resumes uploaded by students.

## Conclusion
The backend for this project was fully developed, and the frontend development was started. Although the project could have been presented as a prototype for the app, some constraints prevented its completion. Despite this, the foundation laid by the backend work shows the potential for further development and completion.
